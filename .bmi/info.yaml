summary: "The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is
  a model-data intercomparison and integration project designed to
  improve the performance of land models and, in parallel, improve the
  design of new measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties
  associated with key land surface processes. ILAMB software can be
  used to quantitatively compare CMIP5-compatible model outputs with a
  set of benchmark datasets. Skill scores computed by ILAMB are
  returned in both tabular and graphical formats."
